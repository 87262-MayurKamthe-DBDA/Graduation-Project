# Graduation-Project : Electric Steering Mechanism
Converting a conventional hydraulic manual steering system into an electric one using motors, sensors, and a controller, reducing parts and complexity. 
The system integrates ultrasonic sensors, limit switches, an 8-bit AVR microcontroller, and a relay circuit with a DC motor for Ackermann Steering Geometry. 
A working model was developed and successfully demonstrated.
